      institution: Novin Barnameh Kara (NOBKA)
      year: 2023 - 2024
      Projects:
        - Speech to Text: I have used several English STT models to fine-tune them on a Persian dataset in order to enhance their accuracy.
        - Text to Speech for Persian Language: I have utilized several English TTS models to fine-tune them on a Persian dataset in order to facilitate this process for Iranian. Even I tried to add emotion speech generation (angry, happy, and etc) to the system in order to get new a novelty for this language.
        - Image Steganography: I have developed a novel method to hide information such as image, text, and etc either encrypted or raw into the image without loss with high performance action.
        - Text Steganography: Regarding to the monitoring system in some countries beside hackers attacks, I create a technique for completely changing the structure of the a text (it could be a word, a sentence or a paragraph) to a new thing which is completely different with the original text. It could be revert to the base form by have some hyperparameter and the algorithm and the book which have been using for transforming the text.

      institution: Payesh Pishrafteh Amin (NOVE)
      year: 2021 - 2022
      Projects:
        - Aerial Image Segmentation: I have used several sota models to segment the aerial image accurately as much as possible.
        - Objects Detection in Instagram Screenshots: By using the template matching and several other image processing algorithm I developed a service to find some details about instagram screenshots.
        - Sneeze and Cough Detection: Although many model for voice classification have already existed, I made a highly light one to use in mobile devices to detect environment cough and sneeze.
