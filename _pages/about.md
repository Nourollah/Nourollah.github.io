I earnestly hold a Master of Science degree in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics from Shahrood University of Technology, a milestone achieved in 2023. Throughout my master's journey, I dedicated my research to pioneering the application of deep learning techniques for neuronal image segmentation and analysis, pushing the boundaries of innovation in this dynamic field.

Preceding this accomplishment, I earned a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry-Information Technology from the esteemed Islamic Azad University, Tehran North Branch, graduating in 2020. These academic endeavors reflect my unwavering commitment to academic excellence and my fervent pursuit of knowledge at the intersection of technology and science.

With a rich background in coding languages including Python, Java, and C++, I bring a formidable array of skills to the forefront. Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have cultivated advanced programming acumen while delving deep into the nuances of software engineering best practices. My expertise spans the spectrum, encompassing the art of crafting reusable and efficient code, architecting programs for heightened readability and maintainability, and adeptly troubleshooting intricate issues. Moreover, I possess a keen aptitude for seamlessly integrating disparate components into cohesive, fully functional software solutions. My forte lies in the swift prototyping of systems, the implementation of intricate algorithms, and the delivery of robust, production-ready code across multifaceted domains. Committed to remaining at the vanguard of technological advancements, I steadfastly evolve and refine my programming prowess to meet the ever-changing demands of the industry.

Presently, my research pursuits delve into the intricate realms of graph neural networks, reinforcement learning, and multimodal deep learning. While my fervor lies in contributing substantively to the field of computer science, I am particularly compelled to spearhead groundbreaking advancements in deep learning, transcending disciplinary boundaries to enrich the landscape of chemistry as an interdisciplinary frontier.

I firmly assert that the accessibility of data fundamentally shapes the trajectory of machine learning and software engineering endeavors. Moreover, the wealth of data available in domains like chemistry and energy science holds immense promise when integrated with machine learning methodologies. This fusion has the potential to revolutionize our daily lives, opening new avenues for software development and applications that cater to the evolving needs of society.

I believe in the symbiotic relationship between various scientific disciplines, where techniques and insights from one field have the transformative power to catalyze breakthroughs in another. This interconnectedness fosters a dynamic environment where innovations in one science can ignite the inception of new paradigms in others, ushering in an era of collaborative progress and interdisciplinary discovery.

In the tapestry of my daily life, fitness and sports weave a profound and essential thread. I immerse myself in rigorous training sessions that span the disciplines of Muay Thai, Judo, Running, and Swimming. Beyond mere physical conditioning, these activities serve as crucibles for sharpening mental focus and as potent stress-relievers. With unwavering dedication to Muay Thai and a fervent passion for Judo, I find deep fulfillment in the pursuit of these disciplines. Embracing an ethos of active living and holistic well-being, I welcome the challenges inherent in these sports, pushing my boundaries and savoring every step of the journey toward enhanced fitness and vitality.
