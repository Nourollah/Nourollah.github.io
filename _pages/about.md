I am PhD Student at Cardiff University. My research field is an interdisciplinary area between Computer Science and Chemistry.
My research interests include multimodal deep learning, reinforcement learning and computational chemistry.

Before starting my PhD, I worked as a software engineer and machine learning researcher in the industry for several years.
I have a Master's degree in Computer Science from the Shahrood Univeristy of Technology.
Moreover, I have a Bachelor's degree in Chemistry from the Islamic Azad University. 

My daily life is a combination of coding, reading papers and books, and sports. 
In Addition, I am playing Dota 2 game with my friends in some of my free time.
I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn new things either in my research field or in my personal life, meet new people, and explore new places.
