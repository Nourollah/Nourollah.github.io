I hold a Master of Science degree in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics from Shahrood University of Technology, which I completed in 2023. My master's research focused on using deep learning for neuronal image segmentation and analysis. Previously, I earned a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry-Information Technology from the Islamic Azad University, Tehran North Branch in 2020.

I have several years of experience coding in languages like Python, C++, Java, and Bash scripting. Throughout my academic and professional career, I have acquired advanced programming skills and knowledge of software engineering best practices. I am adept at writing reusable and efficient code, structuring programs for readability and maintainability, debugging issues, and integrating different components into a fully functional software. My programming expertise allows me to rapidly prototype systems, implement complex algorithms, and deliver robust, production-ready code across diverse domains. I stay up-to-date on the latest technologies and techniques to continue strengthening my programming skills over time.

Fitness and sports are an important part of my life. I actively train in Muay Thai, Judo, Running, and Swimming. These activities provide me with valuable physical conditioning, mental focus, and stress relief. I have been practicing Muay Thai for several years and Judo is another passion of mine. Overall, I am committed to living an active, healthy lifestyle through my involvement in these sports. The disciplines they require help me push my boundaries and enjoy the journey to better fitness.
